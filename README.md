A Webocket server for collecting data and real-time reasoning for `Generation of Real-time Robotic Emotional Expressions Learning from Human Demonstration in Mixed Reality`.
This repo forks the flow-matching model repo for training and inference: https://github.com/HRI-EU/flow_matching.git

## Key components
🔬 **This repo contains** \
Training and evaluation examples of using flow matching on PushT and Franka Kitchen benchmarks.

🌷 **Getting Started**
1. Clone this repo and change into it: `git clone git@github.com:HRI-EU/flow-matching-policy.git && cd flow_matching` \
2. Install the Python dependencies: `python -m venv venv_fm && source venv_fm/bin/activate && pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt`
3. Enjoy!

<!--* Tulip variations with access to a tool library
  * `MinimalTulipAgent`: Minimal implementation; searches for tools based on the user input directly
  * `NaiveTulipAgent`: Naive implementation; searches for tools with a separate tool call
  * `CotTulipAgent`: COT implementation; derives a plan for the necessary steps and searches for suitable tools
  * `InformedCotTulipAgent`: Same as `CotTulipAgent`, but with a brief description of the tool library's contents
  * `PrimedCotTulipAgent`: Same as `CotTulipAgent`, but primed with tool names based on an initial search with the user request
  * `OneShotCotTulipAgent`: Same as `CotTulipAgent`, but the system prompt included a brief example
  * `AutoTulipAgent`: Fully autonomous variant; can use the search tool at any time and modify its tool library with CRUD operations
  * `DfsTulipAgent`: DFS inspired variant that leverages a DAG for keeping track of tasks and suitable tools, can create new tools-->
